# automatic_paste_dispenser
The Automatic Paste Dispenser is a smart system designed to dispense toothpaste (or similar paste) automatically when it detects an object (like a toothbrush) in front of the tube opening.
It uses an IR sensor for detection, a stepper motor for pressing out the paste, an OLED display for real-time feedback, a piezo buzzer for audible notification, and an LED to indicate active dispensing.

Features

Automatic Detection: 

IR sensor detects when an object is placed near the dispenser.

Stepper Motor Control: A stepper motor presses the tube to dispense the paste accurately.

OLED Display: Displays real-time system status, including:

"Object Detected"

"Dispensing..."

Audio Feedback: A piezo buzzer sounds when the paste is being dispensed.

Visual Indicator: An LED lights up during dispensing for clear visual feedback.

Components Used:

IR Sensor

Stepper Motor

Motor Driver

OLED Display

Piezo Buzzer

LED


How It Works:

The IR sensor continuously checks for any object in front of the dispenser.

When an object is detected:

The OLED screen displays "Dispensing...".

The stepper motor is activated to press out the paste.

The piezo buzzer emits a short beep.

The LED lights up to indicate active dispensing.

When no object is detected:

The OLED shows "Waiting for object".


Usage
Simply place your toothbrush or object in front of the dispenser's IR sensor, and the system will automatically dispense the right amount of paste.
